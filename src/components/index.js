// This file is used to export all the components in a single file for easier imports in other parts of the application.
// This is a common practice in React applications to create an index.js file in the components directory that exports
// all the components. This way, you can import components from a single file instead of having to import each component individually from its own file.
//
// Also helps in reducing the number of import statements in App.js and other files and makes the code cleaner and more organized.
